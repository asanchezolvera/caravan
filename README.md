## What is Caravan?

Caravan is a headless ecommerce platform built with [Go](https://golang.org/) using the [Fiber](https://gofiber.io) web framework, itself built on top of [Fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp), the fastest HTTP engine for Go.

## Dependencies

This repository is officially supported on the most recent version of Go.

It depends on a number of [external dependencies] (./go.mod), and uses Go [Modules] (https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage them. Running any `go` command will automatically download and install the dependencies required for that operation.
